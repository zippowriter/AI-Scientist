This can be implemented by adding a term to the loss that penalizes the off-diagonal elements of the covariance matrix of the latent vectors. Modify the `train` method to include this additional regularization term in the loss computation.",

Define TSL as the L2 norm of the difference between consecutive pen movements. Modify the `train` method to include TSL in the loss computation. Implement an adaptive weighting mechanism that adjusts the influence of TSL based on the variance of pen movements within a sequence. Evaluate the quality and diversity of the generated sketches with and without TSL.",

        "Experiment": "In this experiment, we introduce an attention mechanism to the decoder RNN. This involves adding an attention layer that computes a context vector at each decoding step by taking a weighted sum of the latent representations. The context vector is concatenated with the decoder's hidden state and the current input to generate the next output. Modify the `DecoderRNN` class to include the attention mechanism and adjust the `forward` method accordingly. Evaluate the quality and diversity of the generated sketches with and without the attention mechanism.",
