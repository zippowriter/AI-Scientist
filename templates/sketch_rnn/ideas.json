This can be implemented by adding a term to the loss that penalizes the off-diagonal elements of the covariance matrix of the latent vectors. Modify the `train` method to include this additional regularization term in the loss computation.",

        "Experiment": "In this experiment, we introduce an attention mechanism to the decoder RNN. This involves adding an attention layer that computes a context vector at each decoding step by taking a weighted sum of the latent representations. The context vector is concatenated with the decoder's hidden state and the current input to generate the next output. Modify the `DecoderRNN` class to include the attention mechanism and adjust the `forward` method accordingly.

Implement a `dropout_scheduler` function that decreases the dropout rate from 0.5 to 0.1 linearly over the training steps. Modify the `EncoderRNN` and `DecoderRNN` classes to accept a dynamic dropout rate parameter. Update the dropout rate in each forward pass of the encoder and decoder based on the current training step.
