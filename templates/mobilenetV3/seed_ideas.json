      "Experiment": "Implement the Universal Inverted Bottleneck (UIB) block. The UIB block extends the MobileNet Inverted Bottleneck (IB) block by adding two optional depthwise convolutions: one before the expansion layer and one between the expansion and projection layers. This flexible structure allows the UIB to instantiate four variants: 1) MobileNet Inverted Bottleneck, 2) ConvNext-Like, 3) ExtraDW (a novel variant with both optional depthwise convolutions), and 4) FFN (Feed-Forward Network). Construct several MobileNetV4-style models of varying sizes (e.g., Small, Medium, Large) using the UIB blocks. Evaluate the resulting models on ImageNet classification, measuring both accuracy and latency across a range of mobile hardware (CPUs, GPUs). Compare the performance and efficiency of these UIB-based models against baseline MobileNetV3 and other state-of-the-art efficient models.",
