        "Experiment": "Modify the seir_eq function to implement multiple thresholds for adjusting the contact rate based on the proportion of infected individuals. Define specific behavior change scenarios (e.g., reduced contact rates at 1%, 5%, 10% infection levels) and analyze their impacts on peak infections and total infections. This will allow for a more detailed understanding of how varying public health responses can influence disease spread.",
