        "Experiment": "Modify the seir_eq function to implement multiple thresholds for adjusting the contact rate based on the proportion of infected individuals. Define specific behavior change scenarios (e.g., reduced contact rates at 1%, 5%, 10% infection levels) and analyze their impacts on peak infections and total infections. This will allow for a more detailed understanding of how varying public health responses can influence disease spread.",

Implement various vaccination strategies with defined vaccination rates (e.g., 0.1% per day) and specify vaccine efficacy duration (e.g., 6 months). Conduct sensitivity analyses to assess how varying vaccination rates and durations affect peak infections and total infections over time. Compare immediate, phased, and delayed vaccination strategies in terms of their effectiveness in controlling the outbreak.",

Define three levels of social distancing (mild, moderate, strict) triggered at specific infection thresholds. Analyze the outcomes in terms of peak infections, total infections, and the duration of the epidemic, comparing results with and without these distancing measures.",
